title: Introduction

Given that I have a high profile paper combing out in nature soon, I figured it would be a good idea to make a professional page where I can post about the goings on in my life and point people towards the work that I've done throughout my PhD. 

There isn't much here right now, but hopefully as time grows I wiil add more to this site as time goes on, both about my professional endeavors as well as the things important to me in life (Bicycles, My dog Eva and videogames).  

The Nature paper will be available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1991-8) once the embargo lifts (11:00am on Feb 19th 2020).  After that date If you would like to read the paper but do not have access to the nature paywall please contact me via [email](mailto:Ben.Hmiel@gmail.com) and I can provide you with a manuscript.
