Wow, just.... Wow.  I knew that my paper was going to make some buzz in the community of scientists studying atmospheric methane, but I didn't expect to be covered and interviewed in so many major press outlets.  This whole thing feels like an out-of-body experience to myself as a young scientist who just finished grad school and is still at the beginning my career.

My contact in the media communications dept. at UofR compiled a list of the (largely US based) articles she had come across:

Also, I'm not sure if this is because my paper has garnered a lot of attention or this is a new initiative that Nature is pursuing, but they've given me a link to the read only version of the article that I'm allowed to distribute without limitations including my own personal website!

This has been an exhausting week and I am finally going to turn my focus back to some of the firn modeling for CO stable isotopes at Summit and 14CO at Law Dome, Antarctica that I am doing with my short postdoc.  Also applying for more jobs and permanent positions in the future!
