### Welcome to my personal page!

I currently live in Rochester, NY and recently completed my PhD in Geoscience at the University of Rochester working in the [Ice core and Atmospheric Chemistry Lab](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/ees/petrenko/index.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Vasilii Petrenko](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/ees/people/faculty/petrenko_vasilii/index.html).  Check out our [research blog](https://rochestericelab.wordpress.com/) for photos and stories from our polar expeditions.

I'm working a temporary position as a Postdoctoral Associate in the same group and actively seeking employment starting in May 2020.  [Here's my CV](https://benhmiel.github.io/Content/CV_Hmiel_Jan20.pdf) and please don't hesitate to contact me via [email](mailto:Ben.Hmiel+webcontact@gmail.com).

First and foremoest I consider myself an Analytical Chemist. I specialize in making extremely challenging measurements - throughout my PhD this involved the measurements of 14C fropm gases trapped in ice core bubbles, but I'm looking towards new settings of challenging measurements in my future.

My research interests include: climate science, paleoclimate, atmospheric chemistry, the global methane budget, cosmogenic isotopes, and isotope geochemistry.

My Laboratory Skills include operation of vacuum systems for trace gas extraction and measurement, analytical instrumentation using gas chromatography and cavity ring down spectroscopy, and numerical aata analysis using Matlab and Igor Pro.

Outside of science, I like to ride bicycles on any and all terrain (Road, gravel and Mtb singletrack), spend quality time with [my dog Eva](https://benhmiel.github.io/Photos/Eva%20Smile.JPG) and play classic videogames from the 16bit era, especially the [ALttP Randomizer](https://alttpr.com/en).
