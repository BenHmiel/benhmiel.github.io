### Welcome to my personal page!

I currently live in Rochester, NY and just recently completed my PhD in Geoscience at the University of Rochester working in the [Ice core and Atmospheric Chemistry Lab](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/ees/petrenko/index.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Vasilii Petrenko](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/ees/people/faculty/petrenko_vasilii/index.html).  

I'm working a temporary position as a Postdoctoral Associate in the same group and actively seeking employment starting in May 2020.  [Here's my CV](https://benhmiel.github.io/Content/CV_Hmiel_Jan20.pdf) and please don't hesitate to contact me @ [Ben.Hmiel@gmail.com](mailto:Ben.Hmiel@gmail.com)

First and foremoest I consider myself an Analytical Chemist who specializes in making extremely challenging measurements.  

My research interests include: Climate science, Paleoclimate, Atmospheric chemistry, The global methane budget, Cosmogenic isotopes, and Isotope geochemistry.

My Laboratory Skills include operation of vacuum systems for trace gas extraction and measurement, Analytical instrumentation using gas chromatography and cavity ring down spectroscopy, Data analysis using Matlab and Igor Pro  

Outside of science, I like to ride bicycles on any and all terrain (Road, gravel and Mtb singletrack) and enjoy replaying classic videogames from the 16bit era, especially the [ALttP Randomizer](https://alttpr.com/en).
